# Agent API (Node.JS)

The this repository contains the Node.JS implementation of the client-side of the [Agent API][]
available on each TAG Neuron(R) installation. You can use the [Agent API][] to create digital identities and interact
and interoperate in the federated Neuron(R) network.

[Agent API]: https://lab.tagroot.io/Documentation/Neuron/Agent.md

# Note

There already exists a [Javascript implementation](https://github.com/Trust-Anchor-Group/AgentApiJavascript) of the API. The main difference is that this implementation is stripped the ussage of browser APIs and uses Node-fetch for requests.

## For more information

The [Agent API][] is described on the documentation wiki at: <https://lab.tagroot.io/Documentation/Neuron/Agent.md>.
You can also try the requests at that site.
